# Project 1 - *MyStory*

Submitted by: **Alfredo Cabanas**

**MyStory** is an app that introduces a very brief introduction to Gojo Satoru; a character in the Jujutsu Kaisen manga and anime. 

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are able to see a customized app icon and launch screen
- [X] Your app should work for any screen size and orientation using AutoLayout constraints
- [X] Users are able to see at least 3 context items
- [X] Users are able to tap into each context item and see detail view contains information about each item (title, description, picture if applicable, etc.)
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring
- [ ] Allow users to scroll when context items are off-screen (table view implemention)

## Notes

I faced many challenges. The most dificult one was creating a data model object (ContextItem) similar to what we did with the Dinosaur data model in the lab. Apart from this many other nuanses where difficult as this was my first time working with Swift and building an app.
